# Final-project-concept
FocuPlz
FocuPlz is a “time manager” and “digitalized work companion" for people to stay focus
and productive when they work at home or remotely.

Summary
The user needs to set a timer and turn on the webcam to start.
FocuPlz has two different work modes: “Focus mode” and “Deep focus
mode”. The “Focus mode” will only detect people's body posture,
while the “Deep focus mode” also detects whether the user is using the
mouse.

Once the user starts the “Focus mode”, user needs to focus on the work or a little character will show up and ask you to focus.
If the camera can’t detect the user or any mouse movement, the character might have some responding reactions as well.

The main goal of the project is not only to help people to get more work done but also to
give support and delightfulness when people work alone.
